# Setup instructions

### Requirements

You need the following to successfully build the project on your machine:

- A C++ compiler
- A package manager (vcpkg on windows, brew on mac)
- CMake

### Installing packages

#### Windows

First, download vcpkg from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) and find that directory using the command line.  
Hook up user wide integration via the following command:  
> .\vcpkg integrate install

Then, install the necessary libraries using the following commands:

> .\vcpkg install sdl2:x64-windows  
> .\vcpkg install openal-soft:x64-windows  
> .\vcpkg install glew:x64-windows  
> .\vcpkg install freetype:x64-windows  
> .\vcpkg install imgui

#### Mac

On mac, use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to get the needed library files.  
Run the following commands to get SDL, GLEW, and FreeType setup on your local machine.

> brew install sdl2  
> brew install sdl2_mixer  
> brew install glew  
> brew install freetype  
> brew install imgui  

### Running cmake

For this project, it is recommended to use an **out of source** build so that the build files don't interfere with the source files.  
To do so, first make a directory called **build**, and *cd* into it on the command line.  
Then, run the following command to generate the project:  
> cmake ..

Alternatively, you can use the included script files to generate the cmake build, just run the following command on windows:
> build.bat

## Working with the project

The project should be all set up now. On windows, simply open the .vcxproj file to open the project in Visual Studio.
